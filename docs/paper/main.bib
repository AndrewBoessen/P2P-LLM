  abstract = {It is shown that if an iterative price mechanism depends only upon
              a finite amount of information from the market as given by the
              aggregate excess demand function, then this mechanism cannot always
              be effective. That is, there are pure exchange economies where this
              mechanism will not find a price equilibrium. This statement already
              holds in the case of two commodities. The approach used to reach
              this conclusion extends to other iterative systems used to
              determine the zeros of a function.},

              of blockchain technology has increasingly emerged in energy markets
              and shows great potential to facilitate Peer-to-Peer energy

              ‘trilemma’: scalability, security, and decentralisation.
              Peer-to-Peer energy trading is the focus of this paper, which
              ultimately proposes a blockchain scalability solution. This
              solution is empirically modelled using data collected in a trial
              case study. The proposed solution increases scalability without
              compromising security and decentralisation when compared to base

  ABSTRACT = {In the current complex financial world, paper currencies are
              vulnerable and unsustainable due to many factors such as current
              account deficit, gold reserves, dollar reserves, political
              stability, security, the presence of war in the region, etc. The
              vulnerabilities not limited to the above, result in fluctuation and
              instability in the currency values. Considering the devaluation of
              some Asian countries such as Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Türkiye, and
              Ukraine, there is a current tendency of some countries to look
              beyond the SWIFT system. It is not feasible to have reserves in
              only one currency, and thus, forex markets are likely to have
              significant growth in their volumes. In this research, we consider
              this challenge to work on having sustainable forex reserves in
              multiple world currencies. This research is aimed to overcome their
              vulnerabilities and, instead, exploit their volatile nature to
              attain sustainability in forex reserves. In this regard, we work to
              formulate this problem and propose a forex investment strategy
              inspired by gradient ascent optimization, a robust iterative
              optimization algorithm. The dynamic nature of the forex market led
              us to the formulation and development of the instantaneous
              stochastic gradient ascent method. Contrary to the conventional
              gradient ascent optimization, which considers the whole population
              or its sample, the proposed instantaneous stochastic gradient
              ascent (ISGA) optimization considers only the next time instance to
              update the investment strategy. We employed the proposed forex
              investment strategy on forex data containing one-year multiple
              currencies’ values, and the results are quite profitable as
              compared to the conventional investment strategies.},

  abstract = {A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow
              online payments to be sent directly from one party to another
              without going through a financial institution. Digital signatures
              provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a
              trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending.
              We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a
              peer-to-peer network. The network timestamps transactions by
              hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work,
              forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the
              proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the
              sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the
              largest pool of CPU power. As long as a majority of CPU power is
              controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network,
              they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The
              network itself requires minimal structure. Messages are broadcast
              on a best effort basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network
              at will, accepting the longest proof-of-work chain as proof of what
              happened while they were gone.},

              Proof-of-Work (PoW) for that purpose, but PoW possesses significant
              shortcomings. Various alternatives have been proposed. This paper
              provides the first formal economic model of the most famous
              alternative, Proof-of-Stake (PoS), and establishes conditions under
              which PoS generates consensus. A sufficiently modest reward
              schedule not only implies the existence of an equilibrium in which
              consensus obtains as soon as possible but also precludes a
              persistent forking equilibrium. The latter result arises because
              PoS, unlike PoW, requires that validators are also stakeholders.},
