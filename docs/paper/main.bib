  abstract = {It is shown that if an iterative price mechanism depends only upon
              a finite amount of information from the market as given by the
              aggregate excess demand function, then this mechanism cannot always
              be effective. That is, there are pure exchange economies where this
              mechanism will not find a price equilibrium. This statement already
              holds in the case of two commodities. The approach used to reach
              this conclusion extends to other iterative systems used to
              determine the zeros of a function.},

  abstractNote = {In this paper we present BitWorker, a platform for community
                  distributed computing based on BitTorrent. Any splittable task
                  can be easily specified by a user in a meta-information task
                  file, such that it can be downloaded and performed by other
                  volunteers. Peers find each other using Distributed Hash Tables
                  , download existing results, and compute missing ones. Unlike
                  existing distributed computing schemes relying on centralized
                  coordination point(s), our scheme is totally distributed,
                  therefore, highly robust. We evaluate the performance of
                  BitWorker using mathematical models and real tests, showing
                  processing and robustness gains. BitWorker is available for
                  download and use by the community.},

  abstract = {The increasing amount of distributed power generation from rooftop
              solar panels allows new electricity markets to emerge in which
              prosumers and consumers can trade locally produced energy. The use
              of blockchain technology has increasingly emerged in energy markets
              and shows great potential to facilitate Peer-to-Peer energy
              trading. However, blockchain technology is still in its infancy
              meaning it is not yet being used to its’ full potential. In this
              paper, blockchain technology for Peer-to-Peer energy trading and
              its implications are explored, especially in view of the
              ‘trilemma’: scalability, security, and decentralisation.
              Peer-to-Peer energy trading is the focus of this paper, which
              ultimately proposes a blockchain scalability solution. This
              solution is empirically modelled using data collected in a trial
              case study. The proposed solution increases scalability without
              compromising security and decentralisation when compared to base
              layer models.},
